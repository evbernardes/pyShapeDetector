# Geometrical primitives

 This submodule defines classes that implement different geometrical primitives.

 ## Available classes
 - **PrimitiveBase**: Base Class, other primitives inherit from it.
 - **Plane**: defined by a unit normal vector (3 elements) and a distance.
 - **Sphere**: defined by a center point (3 elements) and the radius.
 - **Cylinder**: defined by a point at the cylinder's base (3 elements), a vector from base to top (3 elements) and a radius.

## Misc
- **Template**: Blueprint to start implementation of new primitive.
